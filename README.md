I implemented the Tideman voting system (Ranked Pairs), a ranked-choice election algorithm designed to always produce a Condorcet winner when one exists. Unlike simple plurality voting, Tideman eliminates ties and cycles by constructing a directed graph of head-to-head victories between candidates.
